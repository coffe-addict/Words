This file is an overview of technology foundation 1 path created and shared by our CTO Adi Chikara.
It compromises of various technological terminologies that we are going to work around when working with teams.
It is important to atleast understand the basics of what different techniques are used and what workflow we 
follow as a team.

As per our CTO the list of priorities of things that we are going to learn are as follows:-

1>Git 	: Extremely important to know the functionality of git, as most of the part that we'll do from
	now onwards will require collabaration. On distributed projects in order to collabarate one must 
	be familiar with VCS.

2>Linux	: Does not matter which project we are going to work on, its going to be hosted somewhere,
	most of the hosting platforms use linux. Its also important to get along linux.

3>DB	: Databases are very important for any organization to organise and perform efficiently, 
	data is the driving force in the new era of technology. It would be convinient to know its working 
	and how things are arranged at the core of a databse.

4>SDLC	: Vey important to know how software is developed and equally important is to know how to maintain it.

5>Soft	: Day to day meeting and stand-up representation of what work is done and what's remaining. This 
	includes interaction with clients/management on a regular basis. Soft skills is a must to learn skill.


				Time required.


Total duration of course : ~ 80 hrs
Net total duration including hands on practice : 2 * 80 hrs = 160 hrs

Total working days required : 160 / 8 = 20 days.
At least 20 days/3 weeks to complete the path.


Including normal disturbances we should aim for completing with solid understanding within 25 days.

That's it.
