#_TIME MANAGEMENT_

There are some key things to learn from today, they are listed below :

* Challenge yourself, set agressive goals.
* Time required to learn a new skill reduces with your focus
what i'm trying to say is if you are focused while listening to the instructor,
you might save repeating same stuff multiple times.
* In a day try learning different things at different times.
* Hard technical skills at the early, design related skills in noon, soft skills in the evening.
* This is an effective way to increase the overall capacity of your mind, as learning same thing
throught the day is going to decrease your productivity instead of increasing it.
* Keeping this in mind start __today.__
