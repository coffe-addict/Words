Now, we have formally interacted with our CTO.
He has given us very aggressive timeframe of April 15 to complete our given path.

As per our CTO the best practice is to learn many things at a time and professionally you are required to 
process large chunks of information at a time. 
Starting with the list of items that we need to cover :

1>Git & linux.

2>SQL and MongoDB.

3>Algorithms and advance data structures.

4>Design and other things related to it.

5>Communication related courses.
