**This is what I've learned today :** 

### Introduction to Linux CLI.
> Command Line Interface or call it CLI. The course was led by a very experienced instructor. He did many hands on 
implementation of CLI like managing file system, network management, starting a server,etc.
The most interesting one was scripting this is where I learned the most as it was hands on implementation of 
bash (.sh) scripting language.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

### Learning technology in the information age.
> Information is a vast field, since information is basically available for free with access to anyone and
everyone it is very hard to find relevant information(knowledge) out of it. 
This course primarily focuses on the relation between fundamentals, information, knowledge, skills and 
innovation. Strong fundamentals come in handy when starting a new job, but one must be willing to upgrade 
in order to survive in the field of technology. As useful information today might become obselete tomorrow.
With solid foundation, then diving into knowledge will increase your understanding along with working efficiency.

### Human-centered design.
> In this course the main focus was to distinguish between human-centered design and design thinking.
Human centered design focuses on user/client ease. i.e the main purpose to implement human-centered design
technique is to keep in mind what experience will the user experience after using your product/service.
It's a four stage process.
**Discovery**
Before developing your product you must be aware about requirements of the client or problems encountered 
by them. If you are developin software/product for anyone other than yourself, ask the question why and who 
should use your product? What's their feedback after using your product?, Does it solve the problem it is 
required to solve? 
**Ideation**
When you have understanding of the whole picture and the requirements of the project. Start designing them
as per your mind map or any idea you have related to it.
**Implementation**
This is the part where your idea turns into reality or comes as a solution to the problem or you develop 
a new product as per the client.
**Validation**
This is the part where you get to know feedback of what you have developed as a service or a product before
handing over it to the client. If there is gap between what you have developed and what was required to be 
developed, validation gives you feedback where you can bridge this gap.
