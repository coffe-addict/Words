Listening is active hearing. 

There are many ways one can be a better listener : 

Listen better by looking into eyes. Don't overlook them as some people have intimidating aura the look as if they are looking directly into your soul.
Avoid it.

Try to pick up some tone :
Tone is very important as it tells the energy level of the speaker and whether he/she is engaging well with the audience or not.

Simple responding during conversation:
Even a simple nodding head, shaking your head is an indication that you're agreeing on some point. The whole point to listen and get the best out of a conversation or a session is to engage with the speaker by any means.
 
Taking notes:
One of the best and most recommended methods to make most out of a conversation.
And most importantly is that you should write your own note. Not everything should be written in your notes.


Your personal debrief:
You should summarise your notes and after the conversation is over. Going through it again is going to make it far more easy to understand/recall when you look back to what you've written.

Follow up is very important as in form of a quick mail, a phone call or an article or return and report. Something like this.
This is a very interesting aspect of communication which bridges the gap between what the speaker said and what you heard it.
